# ToolRentalStoreApp

A demo app built to improve my understanding of ASP.NET MVC.

The app is a simple mock up of an in house software system for a tool hire company/store.

Built with Entity Framework (code first approach), ASP.NET Web API 2 (C#), jQuery, Bootstrap, Javascript, HTML/CSS.

the app has a variety of plugins to improve its functionality, including:

jQuery validation, twitter's typeahead, bootbox, DataTables, toastr notifications.
